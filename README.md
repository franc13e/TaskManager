# TaskManager Java Swing Application 🗂️

A desktop-based task scheduling and performance testing application built with Java Swing. This project was developed as part of my coursework, applying data structures like Linked Lists and Queues in a practical GUI setting.

## 📌 Features

- 👤 **User Management**  
  - Add or delete users dynamically
  - Store user data in `users.txt`

- ⏱️ **Performance Testing**  
  - Simulate performance with predefined options (e.g., Add 100 users, Delete 150 users)
  - Performance logs displayed in real-time

- 🧠 **Data Structures Used**
  - `LinkedList` for managing users
  - `Queue` for managing system logs

- 🖥️ **Java Swing GUI**
  - User-friendly interface with tabs for different functions
  - Priority color rendering for visual clarity

## 📁 File Structure

- `TaskManager.java` — Main application class with GUI setup  
- `User.java` — User class with data and methods  
- `Task.java` — Task entity for scheduling (if implemented)  
- `PriorityColorRenderer.java` — Custom renderer for UI table highlighting  
- `users.txt` — Text file storing user data

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in **NetBeans**.
2. Make sure your Java SDK is set up.
3. Run the `TaskManager.java` file.

> ⚠️ Make sure `users.txt` is in the root directory for proper loading/saving of users.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Save tasks along with users
- Add login authentication
- Export performance logs to CSV
- UI redesign for modern look
